In 2048, you combine like-numbered tiles numbered with powers of two until you get a tile with the value of 2048. Gameplay consists of swiping the tiles up, right, down and left, and any tiles that match in the direction and adjacent spot will combine in the direction swiped. 2048 is a strategy game similar to Threes!
